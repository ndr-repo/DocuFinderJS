# DocuFinderJS

**DocuFinder** is a JavaScript external attack surface monitoring (EASM) tool that automates traditional open source intelligence (OSINT) techniques to find externally accessible documents within a target domain.
Protect your organization, improve your penetration tests, increase your bug bounty revenue, & more.

# Disclaimer
**DocuFinder is intended for authorized use only**. 

If you are an investigator or intelligence professional, ensure you have proper jurisdiction prior to accessing results. 

For external penetration testers & bug bounty hunters, only access scan results if you have received authorization from the target domain. By running a scan, this is passive reconnaissance. However, opening links contained in scan results is an active engagement. 

These could be files containing sensitive info & downloaded directly to your machine on-access.
I am not responsible for any legal or criminal proceedings filed against you from using this tool.
# Getting Started
To get started with the DocuFinderJS bookmarklet, perform the following:

1. **Open the source code in any text editor**.

2. **Highlight the source code & copy. No need to make any changes**.

3. **Open your browser of choice**. 
	- I have found Firefox works best for working with bookmarklets.

4. **Create a bookmark in your browser's bookmark bar**. 
	- You'll want to set the bar to always appear.

5. **Paste the bookmarklet in the URL section**. 
	- To validate, press the "HOME" key after pasting & verify the entry begins with "javascript:".

6. **Create a name for the bookmarklet**.
	- I recommend setting this to the name included with the release, such as "DocuFinderJS v1.3" This way, when I release updates, you can easily verify if you are running the latest release.

7. **Create a new tab and click on the bookmarklet**. 
	- I recommend running this in a new tab in a dedicated browser for these tools, since you'll have to disable pop-ups. This is only to open windows containing your search results, nothing more.

8. **Enter your target domain in the prompt**. 
	- If you are a penetration tester, this could be a client you are performing passive reconnaissance on. 
	- If you are working on a bug bounty program, the same would apply when this is authorized & in-scope. 
	- If you are a cybersecurity analyst or information security officer, this might be your employer's domain.

9. **Review your results & enjoy**. 
	 - Once again, please verify that the domain containing the files is in-scope for the project you are supporting prior to access.
